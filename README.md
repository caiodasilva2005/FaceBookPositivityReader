Python project for final design project for EECE 2140 by Caio DaSilva and Jack Sweeney.

This project will fetch data from a FaceBook Page and use its information to determine
how positive the page is. The information we will be considering:
likes to follower ratio
messages,
comments
and more.
A trained OpenAI Python API will be used to perform a sentiment anaylsis on the comments and messages
to assign them a positivity score.
There will be GUI that will display the overall positivity score along with other information such as
the page name,
the page image,
the most positive comment,
and more.
